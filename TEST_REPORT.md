# Natural Query Routing Test Report

## 1. Natural-query routing issue fixed

The cricket chatbot previously misrouted natural cricket questions into unrelated team or player lookups.

Fixed behavior:
- Generic ranking questions such as `who is best batsman`, `best batsmen`, `top 10 batsmen`, and `best bowler` are handled as ranking/list questions, not team stats or player stats.
- Virat Kohli team-affiliation questions return a safe verified fallback instead of unrelated franchise output.
- Team stats require an explicit team mention and no longer default to Australia, India, or another team.
- Country encyclopedia text is stripped or omitted before the response payload reaches the frontend.

The chatbot was tested with regression queries for natural cricket questions. The fix prevents generic ranking questions from being misrouted to team statistics and prevents unrelated team fallback for Virat Kohli team queries.

## 8. Before / after examples

### who is best batsman

Before: Returned Australia team statistics such as `Australia has 751 wins...`

After:

```text
Some of the greatest batsmen in cricket history include Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Don Bradman, Brian Lara, Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, Kumar Sangakkara, Steve Smith, and Joe Root. The best depends on format, era, and criteria.
```

### best batsmen

Before: Returned Australia team statistics.

After:

```text
Some of the greatest batsmen in cricket history include Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Don Bradman, Brian Lara, Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, Kumar Sangakkara, Steve Smith, and Joe Root. The best depends on format, era, and criteria.
```

### which team did virat play for last

Before: Returned `Fortune Barishal` or unrelated franchise/team context.

After:

```text
Virat Kohli plays for India internationally and Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL. I could not verify his latest match team from the available archived data.
```

## 9. Remaining limitations

- Subjective ranking answers are safe general guidance, not live ICC rankings.
- Latest-team answers are conservative when latest match-team evidence is not available in the archived data.
- Player stats depend on the local archived dataset and may be sparse for some aliases.
- Live-score answers depend on provider availability, configuration, and rate limits.

## 10. Country encyclopedia confirmation

Tested outputs no longer include country encyclopedia text such as:

- `Australia, officially`
- `Australia is a country`
- `Commonwealth of Australia`
- `land area`
- `sixth-largest country`
- `Tasmania`
- `mainland of the Australian continent`
- `megadiverse country`

The deep test scans the visible summary plus frontend payload fields such as descriptions, insights, detected entities, and entity metadata.
