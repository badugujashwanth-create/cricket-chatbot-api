# Cricket Chat Bot Backend

> **Status: Active Development** — Routing, typed degraded responses, startup, and endpoint smoke checks pass; the optional local Chroma archive is not populated in this checkout.

Express backend for the Cricket Chat Bot. It serves the frontend build, exposes cricket APIs, routes natural-language questions, reads the local Chroma semantic archive, enriches player entities through provider APIs, and pushes live match alerts through Socket.IO.

It helps cricket fans and analysts turn plain-language questions into structured summaries, comparisons, records, and chart-ready responses without coupling the interface to one data provider.

## Architecture

The backend now has one archive source of truth: ChromaDB. Player profiles, team summaries, match summaries, and semantic cache entries are stored and read through `chromaService.js`.

## Installation

```powershell
cd Cricket_chatbot_Backend
npm install
```

## Environment

Create `backend/.env` from `backend/.env.example`, then set only the providers you use.

```env
PORT=3001

CHROMA_MODE=auto

CHROMA_COLLECTION=cricket_semantic_index
CHROMA_PYTHON_BIN=python
CHROMA_HELPER_TIMEOUT_MS=30000

```

## Running Locally

```powershell
cd Cricket_chatbot_Backend
npm start
```

With the recommended `.env`, the server runs at:

```text
http://localhost:3001
```

If the frontend build exists at `../frontend/dist`, the backend serves it. During development, run the frontend Vite server separately.

## Available Scripts

```powershell
npm start
npm run test:cases
npm run test:cricapi
npm run dataset:clean
npm run chroma:build
npm run rebuild:all
npm run chroma:query -- --query "Virat Kohli"
```

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start` | Starts the Express and Socket.IO server |
| `npm run test:cases` | Runs smoke coverage for routing and response shapes |
| `npm run test:cricapi` | Exercises CricAPI endpoints against a running backend |
| `npm run dataset:clean` | Builds `cleaned_balls_all_matches.csv` from raw cricket JSON |
| `npm run chroma:build` | Rebuilds the local Chroma collection directly from the cleaned CSV |
| `npm run rebuild:all` | Alias for the Chroma rebuild path |
| `npm run chroma:query` | Runs a local Chroma query helper |

## Chroma Archive

`scripts/build_chroma_local.py` builds three document types directly into the Chroma collection:

- `player_profile`
- `team_summary`
- `match_summary`

The generated manifest is `chroma_manifest.json`, and `/api/status` reports that manifest plus a Chroma health probe.

Generated local archive artifacts are intentionally not committed:

```text
chroma_db/
chroma_manifest.json
cleaned_balls_all_matches.csv
cleaned_dataset_manifest.json
```

## API Reference

### `GET /api/status`

Returns Chroma readiness, manifest counts, dataset summary, and health probe details.

Example shape:

```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "source": "chroma",
  "db_dir": "path-to-chroma-db",
  "collection": "cricket_semantic_index",
  "counts": {
    "documents": 0,
    "players": 0,
    "teams": 0,
    "matches": 0
  },
  "summary": {},
  "chroma_health": {}
}
```

### Query and Archive Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/about` | Status plus dataset build dates |
| `GET` | `/api/home` | Dashboard summary, leaders, and recent matches |
| `GET` | `/api/options` | Team, season, and venue filters |
| `GET` | `/api/players/search` | Chroma-backed player search |
| `GET` | `/api/players/:id` | Player profile |
| `GET` | `/api/players/:id/summary` | Player stat summary |
| `GET` | `/api/teams/search` | Chroma-backed team search |
| `GET` | `/api/matches` | Chroma-backed match listing |
| `GET` | `/api/matches/:id` | Match summary |
| `POST` | `/api/query` | Main natural-language query endpoint |
| `GET` | `/api/query/stream` | Streaming query endpoint |

### Provider Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/cricapi/live-scores` | Live and recent scores |
| `GET` | `/api/cricapi/players/search` | CricAPI player directory search |
| `GET` | `/api/cricapi/players/:id` | CricAPI player profile |
| `GET` | `/api/cricapi/schedule` | Match schedule |
| `GET` | `/api/cricapi/series` | Series search |
| `GET` | `/api/cricapi/series/:id` | Series details |
| `GET` | `/api/cricbuzz/player-card` | Cricbuzz-backed entity micro-card |

## Query Response Shape

The frontend expects a normalized response:

```json
{
  "type": "comparison",
  "title": "Virat Kohli vs Rohit Sharma",
  "image": "",
  "summary": "Short answer shown in the response card.",
  "stats": {},
  "extra": {
    "action": "compare_players",
    "sources": ["Vector Archive"],
    "detected_entities": []
  },
  "detected_entities": []
}
```

## Live Ingestion

`workers/dailyIngestor.js` polls live provider data when enabled. For completed matches it:

1. checks whether a match document already exists in Chroma
2. fetches scorecard context from CricAPI or scraper fallback
3. builds a semantic match narrative
4. upserts one `match_summary` document into Chroma
5. clears Chroma read caches
6. emits Socket.IO alerts when useful

It does not maintain a secondary archive store.

## Testing

```powershell
cd Cricket_chatbot_Backend
npm run test:cases
```

The smoke suite validates:

- live query routing
- Chroma-backed player and team questions
- rules, history, and record answers
- comparison responses
- missing-Chroma degraded behavior
- match lookup helpers

## Troubleshooting

### Chroma Missing

Check:

```text
GET /api/status
```

Then rebuild:

```powershell
npm run chroma:build
```

### Live Provider Missing

Set `CRICAPI_KEY` in `backend/.env`. Archive and static knowledge queries continue to work without live provider keys.

### Local LLM Missing

The backend can still answer deterministic archive and knowledge questions. For routed reasoning or synthesis, start an OpenAI-compatible local server and set `LLM_ENDPOINT`.

## Example Questions

- `Virat Kohli stats`
- `India team summary`
- `India vs Australia head to head`
- `Compare Rohit Sharma vs Virat Kohli`
- `Highest individual score in ODI`
- `Who won the 2011 World Cup?`
- `What is LBW?`
- `Show recent live scores`
